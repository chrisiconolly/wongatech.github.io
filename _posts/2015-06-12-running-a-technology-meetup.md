title: Running a Technology Meetup

I'm one of the organisers of the [AngularJS London meet
up](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-London/), which attracts 150-200 people each
month. Here are some of the things we’ve done to make the group successful and
how we’re going to keep growing it.

1. Pick a topic people are interested in. If you choose an emerging technology
   or idea you’re likely to have growth.
2. Get great speakers. People who have a public persona from writing books,
   maintaining popular open source projects or regular public speaking will make
   for great events.
3. Use the web to promote your group. We use
   [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) which is excellent. A lot of people use
   Eventbrite or Facebook and there are many other options as well.
4. Get the right size venue for your audience. A venue that’s too small or too
   large detracts from the content.
5. Expect attendees to drop out at the last minute, anything from 20-50%
   depending on your location, topic, speaker and how busy your community
   members are.
6. Give people food and drink if you can. Everybody comments on how well
   organised our events are. I’m sure what they really mean is how awesome the
   free food and drink are.
7. Look for a permanent sponsor or host. This reduces the amount of work you
   have to do for each event.
8. Publish information from the event: slides, photos, videos, code, etc. Making
   content available means people that couldn't be there don't have to miss out.
   It also gives potential new members an idea of what to expect.
9. Don’t just do talks, make sure there’s opportunities for people to talk to
   each other and share ideas and problems. You can try other formats such as
   dojos, show and tell or lightning talks.
10. Consider multiple smaller, local groups in addition to any large groups, to
    keep the community vibe alive as you grow.
